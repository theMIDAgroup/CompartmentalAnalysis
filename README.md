# CompartmentalAnalysis
Matlab Graphic User Interface (GUI) for compartmental analysis of various compartmental systems for the FDG uptake in murine models.

The code is based on the following publications:

2018 F. Delabry and S. Garbarino "Compartmental analysis of dynamic nuclear medicine data: regularization procedure and application to physiology", Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering 1--19.
2016 F. Delbary, S. Garbarino and Vivaldi V "Compartmental analysis of dynamic nuclear medicine data: models and identifiability", Inverse Problems 32 125010


A GUI is provided for the following compartmental systems:

1) a standard 2-D compartmental model for non--reversible FDG uptake. See for instance [2002 Gunn, R.N., Gunn, S.R., Turkheimer, F.E., Aston, J.A. and Cunningham, V.J. "Positron emission tomography compartmental models: a basis pursuit strategy for kinetic modeling. Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism, 22(12), pp.1425-1439].

2) a 4-D compartmental model for FDG kinetic in the kidneys [2014 Garbarino S, Caviglia G, Sambuceti G, Benvenuto F and Piana M
"A novel description of FDG excretion in the renal system: application to metformin-treated models" Physics in Medicine and Biology, 59, 2469-2484 ]

3) a 2-D dual input compartmental model for FDG kinetics in the liver [2015 Garbarino S, Vivaldi V, Delbary F, Caviglia G, Piana M, Marini C, Capitanio S, Calamia I, Buschiazzo A and Sambuceti G, "A new compartmental method for the analysis of liver FDG kinetics in small animal models" European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Research, 2015, 5-35 ].
